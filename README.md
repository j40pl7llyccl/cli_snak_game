## How to run the game
```python
"""
cd /cli_snake_game/cli_snake_game
python ./main.py

"""
```

## Required Python third-party packages
```python
"""
curses==2.2
"""
```

## Required Other language third-party packages
```python
"""
No third-party packages required in other languages.
"""
```

## Full API spec
```python
"""
No APIs required for this project as it is a command-line interface game.
"""
```

## Logic Analysis
```python
[
    ("main.py", "Contains the main entry point of the game. It creates an instance of the Game class and starts the game."),
    ("game.py", "Contains the Game class which handles the game logic. It creates instances of the Snake, Food, and Score classes. It also contains the game loop which continuously updates the game state."),
    ("snake.py", "Contains the Snake class which handles the snake's movement and collision detection."),
    ("food.py", "Contains the Food class which handles the generation of food on the game board."),
    ("score.py", "Contains the Score class which handles the scoring system.")
]
```

## Task list
```python
[
    "score.py",
    "food.py",
    "snake.py",
    "game.py",
    "main.py"
]
```

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
The 'curses' library is used for creating the text-based user interface and handling keyboard inputs. It is a third-party library in Python and needs to be installed separately.

The game board is created using the 'curses' library. The snake is represented as a list of coordinates, and its movement is implemented by adding a new coordinate to the front of the list and removing the last one.

The food is represented as a single coordinate and is generated randomly on the game board.

The score is incremented each time the snake eats the food. The game ends when the snake collides with the game board boundary or with itself.

## Anything UNCLEAR
There seems to be no unclear points in the project requirements and implementation approach. However, the team should be aware that working with the 'curses' library can be tricky, especially when it comes to handling keyboard inputs and updating the game board.
